Dragon Racer2 (ionic2 / angular 2)
=====================

# dragonracer2
A one week Ionic2/Angular2 Framework and Cordova project featuring pixie (2d animation library), gsap (tween), sass, and angular audio.

(for Angular1/Ionic1 visit https://github.com/shaunnez/dragonracer) 

The game is simple, choose how many dragons you want, change the "odds" of each dragon winning (i.e. a real horse race) and bet on the dragon. Utilising a random generator, simulate a real betting and racing enviroment.

All options are configurable (including what animates, how many "steps" there are in the race, disable audio, name each dragon etc). The random generator is stored locally, but can easily be moved to an external API and the app can connect to this instead.

## Installation

You will need to include ionic 2 (beta at this time) on your computer, then git clone the repo and run npm install && bower install. 

To run it, simply open your terminal/cmd prompt, cd to the directory, and run ionic serve.
