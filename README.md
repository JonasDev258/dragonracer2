Dragon Racer2 (ionic2 / angular 2)
=====================

# dragonracer2
An Ionic2/Angular2 Framework and Cordova project featuring pixie (2d animation library), gsap (tween), and angular audio.

(for Angular1/Ionic1 visit https://github.com/shaunnez/dragonracer) 

This ionic project also utilises SASS as it's CSS framework. 

The game is simple, choose how many dragons you want, change the "odds" of each dragon winning (i.e. a real horse race) and bet on the dragon. Utilising a random generator, simulate a real betting and racing enviroment.

All options are configurable (including what animates, how many "steps" there are in the race, disable audio, name each dragon etc)

## Installation

You will need to include ionic 2 (beta at this time) on your computer, then git clone the repo and run npm install && bower install. 

To run it, simply open your terminal/cmd prompt, cd to the directory, and run ionic serve.
